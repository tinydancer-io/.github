Welcome to Tinydancer's official github repository!

We're an open source project, to support our work please don't hesitate to donate here: https://wagmi.bio/tinydancer

Help us help in making the solana ecosystem more secure and trust minimized! 

**Progress:**

We started with an MVP that was our V0 that you can find here: [tinydancer-io/tinydancer](https://github.com/tinydancer-io/tinydancer)

For our V1 we plan to integrate this functionality into the protocol.

Our goal right now is to add support for two things:
- SPV(Simple Payment Verification)
- DAS & SVM Fraud Proofs (Standalone SVM)

We are currently working to describe the spec to add these to the validator and only then will the client
be able to use these methods to verify at various levels.

**You can find our proposals here:**
- [ ] [SIMD-64: Transaction Receipts](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-improvement-documents/64)
- [ ] [SIMD-52: Add Receipt Root to Bankhash](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-improvement-documents/52)
- [ ] [SIMD-54: Sysvar for Active Stake](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-improvement-documents/54)

**Active Repositories**
- [SPV-Validator](https://github.com/tinydancer-io/solana-validator/tree/anoushk1234/receipt-tree)
- [SIMD](https://github.com/tinydancer-io/solana-improvement-documents)

**Experimental Work:**
[Barracuda SPV Plugin](https://github.com/tinydancer-io/barracuda) is a validator plugin that adds support for light clients without changing consensus using the Geyser interface.

**Where can I see the active discussion related to the project?**
- You can see the SIMDs and the `proj-spv` channel in core-engineering in the Solana Tech discord server.
